  storyText: "An alarm begins blaring and immediately your heart sinks as you realize
    that Slorg sentry bots have entered the room.\r\n\r\nYou've failed in your mission
    and more importantly you've failed the Federation and especially your friends.
    As supersonic projectiles pierce your body and blood flows from your wounds you
    wonder what hope is there now, and then darkness.\n\n1. To play again.\n2. To
    quit game."
