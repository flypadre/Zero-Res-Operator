  storyText: 'As you are arguing with the Zeloc you draw the attention of a couple
    of Slorg troopers drinking in the lounge. As they approach you the Zeloc pulls
    out a phase gun and shoots towards the first trooper  barely missing his head.
    Both troopers fire towards the Zeloc. The first misses hitting the wall behind,
    but the second hits you directly in the neck. As darkness comes over  you, you
    realize you have lost your life and failed your mission.
