  storyText: "Your tactical fighting training kicks in naturally. As the first creature
    moves in to attack you pull out an pulse blade from underneath your belt, block
    his attack and pierce the soft tissue under his jaw pushing the blade into his
    brain.\r\n\r\nThe second creature startled by the attack trips and falls towards
    you as you free your blade from the first victim and with a quick slice dispatch
    the second.\r\n\r\nThe third creature seeing his two buddies dead decides to run
    and slips around the corner into the crowd.\r\n\r\nAs you walk out of the alleyway
    you can't believe your luck as the Starbase lounge in directly in front of you.\r\n\r\nPress
    1 to continue."
